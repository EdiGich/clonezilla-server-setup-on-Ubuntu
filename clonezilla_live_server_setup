# Clonezilla Live Server Setup Notes

## Network Configuration

The server requires one network interface with a static IP to serve clients and one interface for internet access.

### Set Static IP for Private Network

The `enp3s0` interface is used for the private DRBL network where clients will boot. It was configured with a static IP address because the standard Ubuntu network configuration files were not present.

The following command was used to create a persistent network profile using `nmcli`:

```bash
sudo nmcli connection add con-name drbl-private ifname enp3s0 type ethernet ipv4.addresses 192.168.100.1/24 ipv4.method manual
```

ceh_user@cehclonezilla:~$ nmcli device status
DEVICE  TYPE      STATE      CONNECTION 
enp3s0  ethernet  unmanaged  --         
enp6s0  ethernet  unmanaged  --         
lo      loopback  unmanaged  --         
ceh_user@cehclonezilla:~$
